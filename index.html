			<h2>Hey there, welcome to my page!</h2>
			<p>
				Hello my name is Steven Pimentel I am currently enrolled in school for front end developing. I have been modding PC games for about 3 years now and I figured to get into coding.
			</p>
			<p> <title>How it all started!</title>
				first started off with messing around with the command prompt and stuff like that I was a beginner i thought it was cool..... 
				OK ok ok... Here is what really happened.
				First i got my first computer and then I got a box that poped up that said please contact mocrosoft and it had a 1-800 number and me not thinking 
				and not knowing if its real or not I called the number the "hacker" got access to my computer and then locked my BIOS and I couldnt get my computer back 
				I had to call the real microsoft company and explain to them what happened.

				Then microsoft sent me a recovery drive then I had to reset it. So I thought it was cool seeing everything he was doing and I was like thats cool I want to learn about it.
				After that i got into modding games and everything so after all that I decided to go back to school 
				for front end developing. I signed up with my local college and they got me signed up for classes.
				I am looking to go back to school after I am done with front end developing for back end developing.


				<h2>Skills I know right now</h2>
				1. Basic trouble shooting Skills.
				2. How to mod a select of games at the moment.
				3. Minor programming knowlage of two-way radios.
