			<p>first started off with messing around with the command prompt and stuff like that I was a beginner i thought it was cool..... 
				OK ok ok... Here is what really happened.
				First i got my first computer and then I got a box that poped up that said please contact mocrosoft and it had a 1-800 number and me not thinking 
				and not knowing if its real or not I called the number the "hacker" got access to my computer and then locked my BIOS and I couldnt get my computer back 
				I had to call the real microsoft company and explain to them what happened.

				Then microsoft sent me a recovery drive then I had to reset it. So I thought it was cool seeing everything he was doing and I was like thats cool I want to learn about it.
				After that I got into modding games and everything so after all that I decided to go back to school 
				for front end developing. I signed up with my local college and they got me signed up for classes.
				I am looking to go back to school after I am done with front end developing for back end developing.
			 
				When I complete both courses I am looking to become a full time developer and work with many people
				I am interested in making websites and many other applications for people.
				I will be putting in the about page some examples of what I have done.
